# TodoApp

TodoApp is a simple React-based application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The application saves the tasks to the local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Toggle Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete by clicking on the circular checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist across page reloads.
